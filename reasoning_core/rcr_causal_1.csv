You will be evaluated based on how close your estimated probability distribution is to the true one.

For example, if the target variable is V01 (which can take values 0 or 1) and you estimate that P(V01 = 0) = 0.4 and P(V01 = 1) = 0.6, your answer must be: {0: 0.4, 1: 0.6} ","{0: 0.46, 1: 0.54}"

### Scenario
Given the system described above, consider the following specific conditions:

### Your Task
Calculate the probability distribution for the target variable X_1, which can take the following values: [0, 1].

Calculate the probability distribution for the target variable X_3, which can take the following values: [0, 1].

### Required Output Format
You must return the probability distribution over all values of the target variable in the format of a Python dictionary. The output should map each value to its estimated probability.
You will be evaluated based on how close your estimated probability distribution is to the true one.

For example, if the target variable is V01 (which can take values 0 or 1) and you estimate that P(V01 = 0) = 0.4 and P(V01 = 1) = 0.6, your answer must be: {0: 0.4, 1: 0.6} ","{0: 0.57, 1: 0.43}"

### Scenario
Given the system described above, consider the following specific conditions:

### Your Task
Calculate the probability distribution for the target variable X_1, which can take the following values: [0, 1].

### Scenario
Given the system described above, consider the following specific conditions:
Without further Observation/Knowledge of other variable.

### Your Task
Calculate the probability distribution for the target variable X_2, which can take the following values: [0, 1].

### Required Output Format
You must return the probability distribution over all values of the target variable in the format of a Python dictionary. The output should map each value to its estimated probability.
You will be evaluated based on how close your estimated probability distribution is to the true one.

For example, if the target variable is V01 (which can take values 0 or 1) and you estimate that P(V01 = 0) = 0.4 and P(V01 = 1) = 0.6, your answer must be: {0: 0.4, 1: 0.6} ","{0: 0.6, 1: 0.4}"

### Scenario
Given the system described above, consider the following specific conditions:
Doing/Imposing that the state X_3 is equal to 0. Observing/Knowing that the state X_2 is equal to 0

### Your Task
Calculate the probability distribution for the target variable X_1, which can take the following values: [0, 1].

### Required Output Format
You must return the probability distribution over all values of the target variable in the format of a Python dictionary. The output should map each value to its estimated probability.
You will be evaluated based on how close your estimated probability distribution is to the true one.

For example, if the target variable is V01 (which can take values 0 or 1) and you estimate that P(V01 = 0) = 0.4 and P(V01 = 1) = 0.6, your answer must be: {0: 0.4, 1: 0.6} ","{0: 0.26, 1: 0.74}"

### Your Task
Calculate the probability distribution for the target variable X_1, which can take the following values: [0, 1].

### Scenario
Given the system described above, consider the following specific conditions:
Without further Observation/Knowledge of other variable.

### Your Task
Calculate the probability distribution for the target variable X_1, which can take the following values: [0, 1].

You must return the probability distribution over all values of the target variable in the format of a Python dictionary. The output should map each value to its estimated probability.
