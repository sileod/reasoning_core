Or else the union is not equal to that empty set.\n\nHence, premises that relate subsets and empty sets, especially empty_set equalities and subset relations involving empty_set, are critical.\n\nPremise 3 relates subset(X1,X2) to missing equality of union(...) and intersection(..., empty_set), gives a direct condition for when equal_sets(union(), intersection()) fails.\n\nPremise 4 relates equal_sets(empty_set, X1) to subset(X1, intersection(empty_set, X2)) which is basically subset to empty_set, since intersection with empty_set is empty.\n\nPremise 1 involves intersection with empty_set but combined with complement(empty_set), which is universal set, but complement(empty_set) is the universal set in standard set theory, not necessarily supported here.\n\nPremise 2 is about member and subsets involving complement(empty_set), which is complex but less directly connected.\n\nTherefore, the two premises that seem minimal and sufficient are (3) and (4).\n\nCheck if either alone is sufficient.\n\n- Premise 3 alone says that if subset(X1,X2), then equal_sets(union(X1,X3), intersection(X4, empty_set)) cannot hold.
